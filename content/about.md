Hi! My name is Diego and I'm a software engineer with academic experience in information retrieval and machine learning.   

Since 2015, I have been working for [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/). I spent several years working on search & ranking financial news and I currently lead a team in the [AI group](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/ai/).

In a previous life I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Studies of Lucca (IMT)](https://www.imtlucca.it/)
and an Associate Researcher at the [High Performance Computing Laboratory (HPC)](http://hpc.isti.cnr.it),  [National Research Council](http://www.cnr.it/en)(CNR).

## (free) Software

I enjoy contributing to open source in my spare time:

In 2016, I contributed to the [release of the Learning to Rank module](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/bloomberg-integrated-learning-rank-apache-solr/) of Apache Solr.  I also gave several talks explainining [how learning to rank works](https://lucidworks.com/post/learning-to-rank-solr/), [how to use the Apache Solr module](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/learning_to_rank/), and problems that we faced at work when [we released learning to rank in production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMuepJpjUjI). 

When in the mood I mantain [json-wikipedia](https://github.com/diegoceccarelli/json-wikipedia), a library to convert Wikipedia xml dumps into a json/avro semistructured format.
