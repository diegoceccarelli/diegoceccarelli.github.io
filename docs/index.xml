      <description>About Me  Hi! My name is Diego and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer with academic experience in information retrieval and machine learning.
Since 2015, I have been working for Bloomberg. I spent several years working on search &amp;amp; ranking financial news and I currently lead a team in the AI group.
In a previous life I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies of Lucca (IMT) and an Associate Researcher at the High Performance Computing Laboratory (HPC), National Research Council(CNR).</description>

      <description>Code Snippets This page contains a small collection of (mainly) bash commands that I discovered during the Ph.D. Bash is evil but during the Ph.D. was often useful to get stuff done quickly (and it is still useful today).
[bash] print a beer icon in a script echo $&amp;#39;\360\237\215\272&amp;#39; or
echo $&amp;#39;\360\237\215\270&amp;#39; echo $&amp;#39;\360\237\215\271&amp;#39; echo $&amp;#39;\360\237\215\273&amp;#39; echo $&amp;#39;\360\237\215\274&amp;#39; From http://codepoints.net/miscellaneous_symbols_and_pictographs
[bash] copy the output of a command to the clipboard (on macosx) echo &amp;#34;pippo&amp;#34; | pbcopy Now cmd+v will paste pippo.</description>

      <description>Semantic Search Shortcuts Dataset This dataset has been used to perform the experiments for the paper When Entities Meet Query Recommender Systems: Semantic Search Shortcuts.
We build a dataset consisting in 130 queries extracted from the http://www.europeana.eu query logs, containing a sample of users&amp;rsquo; interactions covering two years (from August 27, 2010 to January, 17, 2012).
We split the dataset in three disjoint sets:
 The 50 queries in the first set are short (composed by only one term); The second set contains 50 queries having an average length of 4.</description>
